{/* Disability Benefits for Physical Impairments
We provide a comprehensive range of services. We help clients prepare initial
applications. Our physical impairments attorneys help clients from the initial
application to administrative hearings and appeals, fighting to protect our clients&#39;
interests at every stage of the SSD/SSI process. We also represent injured
employees in workers&#39; comp claims.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses a “Sequential Evaluation Process” to
determine whether or not an applicant qualifies for Social Security Disability
Insurance benefits. This is a five-step process that carefully evaluates varying
aspects of an applicant’s capabilities
Step One – Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)
During the initial step of the process, the SSA asks, are you working? More
specifically, are you engaging in what is called “Substantial Gainful Activity.” This is
a two-part test. First, the SSA examines whether or not the work being done is
“gainful,” meaning it generates more than a certain amount of income on a monthly
basis. Then, the SSA examines whether or not the work is “substantial,” meaning
that it is a job in which little or no accommodation is made for a disability.

Step Two – Severity of Impairment
Step two evaluates the severity of your physical or mental conditions . An
impairment is a condition that you have been diagnosed with by a medical provider.
That condition or impairment will be considered “severe” if it impacts your ability to
perform functions essential to work.
The limitations from any particular condition do not have to prevent you from
working, just limit you from performing work normally. It is the cumulative impact of
all of your severe conditions that will determine whether you are approved for
benefits.
Step Three – Meeting Or Equaling A Listing
At step three, the SSA will look at the severity of your disability and impairments
more closely, specifically to determine if you “meet a listing”. The SSA and the Social
Security Act have a detailed listing of criteria that must be either “met” or “equaled”
to be considered disabled as per their definition.
The impairment(s) need not be exactly as listed; however, if they don’t exactly match
the listing, they must be equal in severity to the criteria listed.
Step Four – Past Relevant Work

Step four will assess your ability to perform the duties of your past relevant work
(PRW) considering your residual functional capacity (RFC).
Your RFC is the MOST that you can do given the limitations caused by your severe
impairments. In other words it is a summary of your work related limitations.
Remember that your RFC isn’t the least you can do, it’s the most you’re capable of
doing.
If you can still perform your previous work responsibilities for prolonged periods of
time without physical or mental deterioration, you will not be considered to be
disabled.
Step Five – Other Types of Work
At Step 5, the final step, your impairments will be evaluated to determine whether or
not you can perform the tasks and duties of other types of jobs., if your current
abilities support that you cannot sustain work, you will be considered disabled as
defined by the Social Security Act and will likely be awarded benefits.*/}
